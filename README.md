# Restaurant-Ordering-System

## Overview

Welcome to the Restaurant Ordering System, a console-based application developed in Java using the Eclipse IDE. This system is designed to streamline the ordering process in a restaurant setting, offering users a convenient and efficient way to place and manage their orders. The system utilizes a MySQL database to store and retrieve the restaurant's menu items, providing a dynamic and easily updatable menu for both customers and restaurant staff.

## Features

#### 1. Menu Management

The Restaurant Ordering System uses a MySQL database to store a comprehensive menu. This allows for easy maintenance and updating of menu items, ensuring that the restaurant can adapt to changing offerings seamlessly.

#### 2. Order Placement

Customers can interact with the system to browse the menu, select their desired items, and place orders efficiently. The system supports the placement of multiple orders, accommodating group orders and diverse customer preferences.

#### 3. Billing

At the end of the ordering process, the system generates a detailed bill summarizing the selected items and the total cost. This functionality simplifies the payment process for customers.
